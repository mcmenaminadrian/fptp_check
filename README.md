Explore the fairness of FPTP constituency boundaries

This software will/should:

1. Create a linked list of voters that match the actual result in the selected domain
2. For each constituency conduct a random walk through the list to generate a notional result
3. Repeat 1 & 2 to generate a set of 'random' results which can be compared to the actual result
